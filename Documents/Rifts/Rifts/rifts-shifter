Standard Equipment: Set of clothing, set of traveling clothes, light
M.D.C. body armor (seldom wears heavy armor, because it reduces
one ' s speed and mobility by halt), knapsack, backpack, 1 04 small
sacks, one large sack, pocket mirror, small silver cross, large wood
cross, 2D4 cloves of garlic, six wooden stakes and a mallet (for
vampires and other practical applications), salt, canteen, binoculars,
tinted goggles or sunglasses, air filter and gas mask, pocket laser
distancer, pocket digital disc recorder/player for recording his obser
vations, and a hand-held computer if proficient with computer operation. 
Often wears hooded robes and dark clothing.

Weapons include a survival knife ( 1D4 S.D.C.), hand axe (2D4
S.D.C.), submachine-gun (loaded with silver bullets or other special
rounds), energy rifle, and I D4+2 extra clips of ammunition/E-Clips.
Plus, a j avelin-like iron rod sharpened at on end. The rod generally
measures about three feet (0.9m) long for easy carrying and is used
to dispel certain magic illusions and monsters.

The vehicle of choice is often a motorcycle, hovercycle or horse.
The vehicle is often small, inexpensive and easily replaced in case it
is destroyed by a creature from a Rift or left behind when exploring
a RiftlRifting home.

Money: Starts with 1 06x l 000 in credits and 2D6x l 000 in Black Mar
ket items. Clever Shifters can make considerably more money
quickly, especially if they are clever about using the abilities of their
inhuman servants.

Cybernetics : Starts with none and will avoid getting them like the
plague. W ith the exception of Bio-Systems, cybernetics and bionics
interfere with magic, and in the case of the Shifter, make him appear
weak to his demonic henchmen, most of whom insist the machines
of men are for weaklings.

Note: Shifting is generally considered one of the dark magicks and is
outlawed in some places, and feared and shunned but accepted at
many others. The Coalition States feels that Shifters (as well as
Necromancers and Witches) are horrific monsters to be feared and
destroyed on sight.

Related O.C.C.s: Old and outdated "revised" versions of the Shifter
can be found in Rifts® Dark Conversions™ and Rifts® Dim en
sion Book 7: Megaverse® Builder™. However, the Megaverse®
Builder offers a large selection of unusual alien familiars for the
Shifter as well as in-depth info on dimensional travel, creating dimensions, 
and additional supernatural forces a Shifter can link to.
