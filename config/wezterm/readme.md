# Wezterm Config 

Possible guidance here: https://hackernoon.com/get-the-most-out-of-your-terminal-a-comprehensive-guide-to-wezterm-configuration

keybinds.lua file (not yet implemented) Taken from https://github.com/yutkat/dotfiles/blob/main/.config/wezterm/keybinds.lua
* Looks like yutkat may use tmux as in total setup.  I'd prefer to NOT use tmux if I can replicate the functionality without it (ie. in Wezterm)



Appears to have many vim like bindings

# Initial Thoughts:
  Reccomend configuring Super + HJKL as switching bspwm windows
                        alt + hjkl to switch wezterm panes
