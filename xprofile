# This line swaps caps & left control  
setxkbmap -layout "us" -option "ctrl:swapcaps"

## and this loads a keyboard map so we can make use of Print_Screen wedged between Control_R and Alt_R
## Seriously Lenovo, wtf....
#xmodmap ~/.xmodmap

### Now use xcape to make caps act as esc when pressed and Control_L when held
xcape -e -t 150 'Control_L=Escape'

#### and xcape lets Print act as Print when we don't need it to be Hyper.
#### Make sure you don't have Print taking screen shots unless used with another modifier!  I'm using sxhkdrc
#xcape -e -t 150 'Hyper_L=Print'
